        <p>I'm a student at ixdbelfast with an unhealthy obsession for design.<br><br>

I love all things minimal and streamlined. I am currently studying Interaction Design at The University of Ulster in Belfast, which fuels my passion for UI design. I love creating mockups in Photoshop of any app or website idea that comes into my head.  I first started playing around with design when I was about 14 or 15 and I grew my skills from there.  Thankfully all of my designs from those early days where claimed by a rather nasty virus from an awful Windows XP machine, which kind of did me a favour so thanks Microsoft.<br><br>

I took an Interactive & Creative Media Class at NRC for 2 years which widened my knowledge of design even more and I had my first real classes on HTML5 and CSS3 which sparked my passion even more.  I continued to sharpen my deisgn skills whilst learning code in my spare time.<br><br>

Now I’m here!  That’s where I am up to now finishing up my first semester in IXD Belfast.  Stay tuned for more.
